## What is txmmo?

txmmo is a factory building game, inspired by games like satisfacory and factorio, that runs inside of your terminal. Its an mmo, which means that all players exist on the same map, and any change will be reflected for all players.

Currently txmmo is in an extremely early stage of development and it will likely stay here for quite a long time. This is a long term project of mine, and I'm doing it by myself, so dont expect a release, or even an open beta, any time soon.
